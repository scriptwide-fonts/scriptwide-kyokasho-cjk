# Scriptwide Kyokasho CJK

CJK font based on Klee One Semibold and its derivatives

This font is licensed under OFL.

## Description

Low effort amalgamation of several Klee One-derived fonts with some minute edits.

Glyphs do not necessarily follow any source, but most of them should follow the J-source or G-source.

## Who asked?

1. Why does Scriptwide Kyokasho CJK consist of 2 fonts?
  * One font file can only support 65535 glyphs, therefore the font has to be split to accommodate future additions.
2. Why not 3 fonts?
  * Bad question.
3. Is this README file copied from Scriptwide Sans CJK?
  * Yes.
4. Can I expand on this font?
  * Yes, unless you violate the OFL. You probably won't if you're being reasonable.
5. Aren't there less characters compared to LXGW WenKai?
  * Those are AI placeholder characters produced through zi2zi. To increase quality and to avoid confusion I have removed them. Newer glyphs may still be traced from these AI characters.
6. Why isn't this classified as a Kai font?
  * This is to differentiate the font from proper Kai fonts like TW-Kai. Contrary to popular belief, Klee One is more similar to kyokasho-tai compared to Kai script. However, kyokasho-tai itself is based on Kai script.
7. Your font sucks.
  * I know.
